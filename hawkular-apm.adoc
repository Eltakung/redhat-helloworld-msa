### Deploy Hawkular APM

http://www.hawkular.org/overview/index.html#_application_performance_management[Hawkular APM] can be used as a drop-in alternative to ZipKin.
If you decide to use it instead of ZipKin, you can either change each microservice environment variable named "ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL" to
point to the Hawkular APM server, or change the definition for the `zipkin-query` service, once the Hawkular APM server is available.

#### Deploy using oc CLI

----
$ git clone https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/hawkular-apm.git
$ cd hawkular-apm/hawkular-apm-server
$ oc new-build --binary --name=hawkular-apm-server
$ oc start-build hawkular-apm-server --from-dir=. --follow
$ oc new-app hawkular-apm-server
$ oc expose service hawkular-apm-server
----

#### Getting the admin username and password

Once the service is deployed, the admin credentials can be obtained via Browse → Deployments → hawkular-apm-server → Click on the latest deployment → Logs.
A sample output is as follows:

```
------------------------------------
ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION
We automatically created an admin user for you to access the Hawkular APM web interface:
Username: adminQqyEF7i
Password: KS3mmZbkdhRZ5y7oF
------------------------------------
```

With these credentials, login to Hawkular APM via http://hawkular-apm-server-helloworld-msa.rhel-cdk.10.1.2.2.xip.io/

#### Replacing the ZipKin URL for the services

The recommended approach is to change the environment variable `ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL` to point to the Hawkular APM Server:

```
oc env dc/aloha       ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL="http://hawkular-apm-server:8080"
oc env dc/api-gateway ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL="http://hawkular-apm-server:8080"
oc env dc/bonjour     ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL="http://hawkular-apm-server:8080"
oc env dc/hola        ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL="http://hawkular-apm-server:8080"
oc env dc/ola         ZIPKIN_SERVER_URL="http://hawkular-apm-server:8080"
```
